I am a final year computer science master's student with a interest in technology. I enjoy tackling complex problems, learning how things work under the hood, and building solutions that make a real impact.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a strong passion for cybersecurity. I am now eager to transition into this field, with a particular focus on being a penetration testing specialist or continuing to build impactful solutions as a software developer.
